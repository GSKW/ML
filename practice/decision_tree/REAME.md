# Decision tree

The module contains an implementation of decision tree from scratch.
See [decision_tree.py](decision_tree.py) and [node.py](node.py) for 
implementation code.

Run `python train.py` to train a decision tree on a
[breast cancer dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).
